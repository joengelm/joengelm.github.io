			<h1>Hi, I'm Joe.</h1>

			<p><strong>I'm a design product engineer at Snap</strong>, where I spend most of my time prototyping. I'm based in <strong>NYC</strong>.</p>

			<p>There's not much on this site because <strong>I've been busy</strong> working the past few years! So, don't take this site to be an example of my design or engineering skills. :)</p>

			<p>Before I joined Snap, <strong>I studied at Brown University</strong>. I concentrated in computer science and took additional courses in
			design (including at <strong>RISD</strong>). <strong>I also worked as a teaching
			assistant</strong> for four years.</p>

			<p>In 2014, I also created a server in <a href="https://github.com/joengelm/groupsnap-java">Java</a> and <a href="https://github.com/joengelm/groupsnap">Python</a> that enabled group messaging in Snapchat. The following summer, <strong>I interned at Snapchat</strong> as a prototyper (primarily iOS). Shortly after my internship, Snapchat released group chats and group stories.</p>

			<p>In 2016, <strong>I interned at Pinterest</strong>. I rewrote the most trafficked component on the website (i.e. the "Save" button) with React.js, CSS Modules, and FlowType to dramatically reduce load times.</p>

			<p>While at Brown, <strong>I created
			and managed Brown APIs</strong>, a set of resources for accessing campus data. We built useful interfaces
			for student developers, who in turn, built apps for fellow students. Check out <a href="https://api.students.brown.edu">our site</a>! Our code is open source and available <a href="https://github.com/hackatbrown/apis">on GitHub</a>.</p>
