It&#39;s the BIG APPLE. I&#39;ve never been to New York City before, and it&#39;s time for me to explore everything that the big city has to offer.

I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ve agreed to show me around. What should we do first?!

[[Let&#39;s go watch the Yankees]]
[[It&#39;s up to you!-&gt;What else is on your bucket list?]]

[[You&#39;re right, we all remember buying our first I &lt;3 NY t-shirt. In fact, I&#39;m wearing an I &lt;3 NY t-shirt under my sweater right now. If I ever take it off, I&#39;ll be exiled from the BIG apple and have no where else to go.]]</tw-passagedata>

Well.

Ever since I was 12, I&#39;ve had this dream. A dream I haven&#39;t been able to realize...

<tw-passagedata pid="19" name="What&#39;s your dream?" tags="" position="524,1187">I want to make a reality TV show.

It&#39;ll be a show about cats. But not just any cats! This show will be filmed in space. All the cats will be dressed in tiny spacesuits and be floating around freely.

It&#39;s an absolute money maker. By the time this airs a full season, I&#39;ll be richer than any of these Wall Street bankers. It will revolutionize the future of television and branch out into multiple franchising deals for books, movies, and theme parks!

[[That&#39;s a lot to take in...]]
